    <h1>Chicken Salad</h1>
    <img src="./images/Classic-Chicken-Salad.png" height="250px">
    <p>This traditional Chicken Salad recipe, made with simple ingredients is perfect for make-ahead lunches. There’s so many ways to eat it, like as a chicken salad sandwich, on a bagel, over a salad or in lettuce wraps. It’s is my go-to lunch to keep on hand in the refrigerator to eat throughout the week, or to bring to potlucks and it’s dairy-free, gluten-free, high protein, and low-carb. Some more of my favorite healthy chicken salad recipes are Cilantro Chicken Salad, Ranch Chicken Salad, and Chicken Salad with Lemon and Dill. You may also enjoy my classic Egg Salad.</p>
